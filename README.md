### Hi I'm Sadra! 
Welcome to my new Github profile.

Industrial Engineering student at SBUK, working at the intersection of  
**mathematical modeling**, **optimization**, and **data-driven decision systems**.  
I am broadly interested in turning real-world operational problems into  
computational formulations and designing efficient solution procedures around them.

#### Research Interests

- Mathematical programming (LP, MILP); formulation design and model structuring  
- Optimization modeling using Pyomo and GAMS  
- Data analytics and predictive modeling (scikit-learn, statistical methods)  
- Algorithmic thinking; computational approaches for decision-making problems  
- Systems modeling: scheduling, resource allocation, and analytical operations

#### Technical Skills

**Programming:** Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, SciPy, etc), C++, SQL  
**Optimization Tools:** Pyomo, GAMS, solver workflows  
**Data & Analytics:** feature engineering, EDA, model evaluation  
**Tools:** Git, Linux, Jupyter, VS Code, Excel
